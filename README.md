# ALtcraft Tools
This minecraft mod is intended to be used as a plugin to our (upcoming) alternative crafting mod Altcraft Core, but this tool-enriching plugin can be used as a standalone version too. It adds variants of vanilla and many modded tools based on tool parts like handles wich bring diversity in the tools we all use and love by modifying durability, mining speed, attack speed and enchantability.

## Installation
1. Install [Fabric Loader](https://fabricmc.net/use/) for your Minecraft version
2. Install [Fabric API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api)
3. Download Altcraft Tools from [Curseforge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/altcraft-tools) or from the [releases](https://github.com/Saladan/altcraft-tools/releases) on GitHub and move the .jar file to the mods folder of your instance
4. Download and install compatibility patches for mods you use alongside Altcraft Tools (a list of patches is given below)
5. Enjoy!

## Compatibility
This mod has innate compatibility with [Roughly Enough Items](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/roughly-enough-items) from shedaniel. Full support and tool part display is planned and will be innate.

## Patches
Compatibility patches are listed in the [releases](https://github.com/Saladan/altcraft-tools/releases) tab on GitHub in the list of binaries provided. Please only use the patches you need since they depend on the mods they tackle and your game will crash if those mods aren't present.

### Draylar1's [Vanilla Hammers](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/vanilla-hammers)
 - All added textures are recolored versions of the ones from Vanilla Hammers, so credits go to Draylar1. Same goes for recipes, I just adjusted them to fit the handled recipe type I use in Altcraft Tools.
 - Currently, just vanilla-style hammers are supported by recipe. Handle textures should work well but I am fiddling with the special handles to be got by recipe too.
